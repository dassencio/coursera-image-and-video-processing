Description
===========

This repository contains PDF slides for the Cousera course
"Image and video processing: From Mars to Hollywood with a stop at the hospital".
The slides are produced from screenshots taken for each video and are indexed
in the same way as the lectures.

Each week also contains a file named "WeekN.pdf" (where N is the week number)
which contains all slides for the week as a single PDF file.
