Description
===========

This repository contains PDF slides for the Cousera course "Image and video
processing: From Mars to Hollywood with a stop at the hospital". The slides
were produced from screenshots taken for each video and are indexed
in the same way as the lectures.

Each week directory also contains a file named `WeekN.pdf` (where N is the week
number) which contains all slides for the week as a single PDF file.
